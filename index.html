<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to my website everyone, i hope you like it.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.coryristyoga.com/pages/aboutme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seriously</a>, Welcome and lets all get along nicely..</h2>
<p><strong>Ten fucking declarations, a <code>@media</code> block, and one attribute.</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how much CSS and HTML it took to turn that <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this finally perfect masterpiece. It&rsquo;s so fucking simple and it still has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shit&rsquo;s <em>finally</em> lightweight and loads fast;</li>
<li><em>Finally</em> fits on all your shitty screens;</li>
<li><em>Finally</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers;</li>
<li><em>Won&rsquo;t</em> bleach your fucking eyeballs at night if your browser thinks you like dark things;</li>
<li>The motherfucker&rsquo;s <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site;</li>
<li>Shit&rsquo;s <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across.</li>
</ul>
<h3>And guess what, motherfucker:</h3>
<p>You never knew it, but it&rsquo;s easy to improve reliability on your site. Here&rsquo;s how.</p>
<h2>A little more accessibility</h2>
<p>I know you love marginalization, but you should take care of people. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag doesn&rsquo;t include the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/dom.html#the-lang-and-xml:lang-attributes"><code>lang</code> attribute</a> in your shitty webpage.<br /> You ever listen to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP94u7y_KkQ">wrong language screen reader lecture</a>? What a shitty experience.</p>
<h2>Typography matters</h2>
<p><a href="https://smartquotesforsmartpeople.com/">Don&rsquo;t be dumb with typography</a>. Don&rsquo;t let improper marks and quotes make their way onto websites because of dumb defaults in applications and CMSs.<br /> And did you let the browser choose the font? Don&rsquo;t make me read such text with <em>Times New Roman</em>.</p>
<h2>License, motherfucker</h2>
<p>Do you revendicate intellectual property? No. So you must <a href="https://choosealicense.com/">choose a fucking public license</a>.<br /> And as you&rsquo;ll never be perfect, let others <a href="https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite">improve your shit</a> or <a href="https://github.com/LeoColomb/perfectmotherfuckingwebsite/blob/main/LICENSE">do what the fuck they want to</a>.</p>
<h2>Yes, this is the last fucking satire, you fuck</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m impressed about what the creator of <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site&rsquo;s inspiration did</a>. What I&rsquo;m saying is that it&rsquo;s so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default&mdash;they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they&rsquo;re also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
